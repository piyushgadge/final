      <h1>What is liquor</h1>
      <p class="one">
      Liquor (/ˈlɪkər/ LIK-ər) is an alcoholic drink produced by the distillation of grains, fruits, vegetables, or sugar that have already gone through alcoholic fermentation. Other terms for liquor include: spirit, distilled beverage, booze, spirituous liquor or hard liquor. The distillation process concentrates the liquid to increase its alcohol by volume.[1] As liquors contain significantly more alcohol (ethanol) than other alcoholic drinks, they are considered "harder." In North America, the term hard liquor is sometimes used to distinguish distilled alcoholic drinks from non-distilled ones, whereas the term spirits is more commonly used in the UK. Some examples of liquors include vodka, rum, gin, and tequila. Liquors are often aged in barrels, such as for the production of brandy and whiskey, or are infused with flavorings to form flavored liquors, such as absinthe.
    
    While the word liquor ordinarily refers to distilled alcoholic spirits rather than beverages produced by fermentation alone,[2] it can sometimes be used more broadly to refer to any alcoholic beverage (or even non-alcoholic products of distillation or various other liquids).[3]
    
    Like other alcoholic drinks, liquor is typically consumed for the psychoactive effects of alcohol. Liquor may be consumed on its own ("neat"), typically in amounts of around 50 millilitres (1.7 US fluid ounces) per served drink. In an undiluted form, distilled beverages are often slightly sweet and bitter and typically impart a burning mouthfeel with an odor derived from the alcohol and the production and aging processes; the exact flavor varies between different varieties of liquor and the different impurities they impart. Liquor is also frequently mixed with other ingredients to form a cocktail.
    
    Rapid consumption of a large amount of liquor can cause severe alcohol intoxication or alcohol poisoning, which can be fatal. Consistent consumption of liquor over time correlates with higher mortality and other harmful health effects, even when compared to other alcoholic beverages.[4][5]

      <h1>liqure process</h1>
      <p class="one">
      Alcoholic beverages are made by fermenting different types of grains, fruits, and vegetables. This process creates ethanol, an ingestible type of alcohol.
    
    Some alcohols go through an additional process called distilling that removes the water and increases the alcohol content.
    
    Each liquor is created through a unique process, and each process manipulates the flavor profile and the alcoholic content of the beverage.
    
    Alcohol by volume (ABV) refers to the number of millimeters (mL) of pure ethanol in every 100 mL or 3.4 ounces (oz) of fluid (fl). Base liquors are distilled and have a higher ABV than undistilled drinks.
    
    The proof of any liquor can be found by doubling the percentage of the ABV.
    
    Many of the ABV and calorie ranges below are based on data from Drinkaware, an independent charity that aims to reduce alcohol-related harm.

      </div>
    </div>
      <h3 id="a"> Base liquors </h3>
    <p class="one"> Liquor is usually divided into six main categories: gin, vodka, whiskey, tequila, rum, and brandy. These spirits can be enjoyed as a stand-alone beverage or used as a base in a mixed drink or cocktail.
    </p>
     <h3>Gin</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Gin is typically made from wheat, grain, or barley that’s fermented and distilled. Juniper berries are used to give the liquor its predominant flavor.
    
    One shot (44 mL or 1.5 fl oz) of gin typically contains 40–55% alcohol and about 97 calories. Popular gin cocktails include gin and tonic, martini, and Tom Collins.
    </p>
    <h3>Vodka</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Vodka is popular in cocktails due to its near-flavorless profile. Made with potato, rye, or wheat, the ABV can range from 40–90% per shot.
    
    A vodka with 40% ABV contains about 97 calories per shot. Popular vodka cocktails include vodka and club soda, Cosmopolitan, and Moscow mule.
    </p>
    <h3> Whiskey</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Whiskey is made from fermented and distilled grain, usually from rye, corn, barley, or wheat. One shot of whiskey typically has 40-50% ABV and contains about 105 calories.
    
    Popular whiskey cocktails include Jack and Coke, whiskey sour, and Old Fashioned.
    </p>
     <h3>Tequila</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Tequila is made from the blue agave plant, which is indigenous to Mexico. A shot of tequila typically has 40–55% ABV and contains about 97 calories.
    
    Tequila is used to make Tequila sunrise, Paloma, or taken straight up as a shot with lime.
    </p>
     <h3>Rum</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Rum became popular in the 18th century as travelers explored coastal shores. It’s typically made with sugarcane molasses or sugarcane juice.
    
    Most rums have around 40% ABV and contain about 97 calories.
    
    Popular rum cocktails include Piña Colada, rum punch, and daiquiri.
    </p>
     <h3>Brandy</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Brandy is essentially distilled wine. Apple and plum are popular flavors, but brandy can be made from any fruit.
    
    A shot of brandy has 35–60% ABV and contains about 97 calories.
    
    Popular brandy cocktails include Sidecar, Pisco punch, and Eggnog.
    </p>
    <h3>Sake, shōchū, and soju</h3> 
    <p class="one">
    Some spirits are created and manufactured in East Asia using a different process.
    
    Sake is a popular Japanese alcohol made from fermented rice and contains around 13–17% alcohol.
    </p>
    <p class="one">
    <h2 id="b"> There are five types of sake:</h2>
    <div class="two">
    <ol >
        <li>Ginjo-shu </li>
        <li>Honjozo-shu  </li>
        <li>Daiginjo-shu  </li>
        <li>Namazake </li>
        <li>Junmai-shu </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </p>
    
    <p class="one">
    One shot of sake has about 59 calories.
    
    Shōchū is also from Japan and is made from sweet potato, rice, and barley. Shōchū is typically 20–35% alcohol. There are two types: otsuri and korui.
    
    One shot of shōchū has about 39 calories.
    
    Soju is a Korean spirit similar to vodka and is usually around 20% alcohol. It’s made from rice or sweet potato. One shot of soju has about 60 calories.
    </p>
     <h3>Liqueurs</h3>
    <p class="one">
    Liqueurs are flavored with natural or artificial sweeteners and are often used alongside base liquors to create cocktails. Liqueurs typically have a higher calorie count than base liquors.
    
    A shot of absinthe, for example, is 45–74% alcohol and contains about 153 calories.
    
    Other popular liqueurs include:
    <p class="one">
      <div class="two">
    <ol>
      <li>Amaretto (21-28% ABV)</li>
      <li>Schnapps (15–20% ABV)</li>
      <li>Triple sec (20–40% ABV)</li>
      <li>Curaçao (15–40% ABV)</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  </p>
    </p>
   
      <p class="one">
      Unfortified and fortified wines
    The alcohol content of unfortified wine is usually lower than that of liquors, typically ranging between 12–15%. Fortified wines have 16–24% ABV.
    
    One serving of wine is 174 mL or 5 fl oz.
    
    Red
    Red wine is made by crushing dark-colored grapes and allowing them to ferment. The skins are left on the grape to help influence the deep color and taste of the wine.
    
    Popular red wines include cabernet sauvignon, merlot, and pinot noir.
    
    One serving of red wine has around 125 calories.
    
    Rosé
    Rosé is made the same way as red wine but is fermented for a shorter period. Rosé usually contains natural sugar and starches, making the calorie count higher than base liquors. It can be still or sparkling.
    
    One serving of red wine has around 138 calories.
    
    White
    White wine is made from fermented grapes without the skins. All grapes are the same light color inside, so any grape can be used to make white wine.
    
    Popular white wines include chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, and pinot grigio.
    
    One serving of white wine has around 120 calories.
    
    Sparkling
    Sparkling wine, also known as dessert wine, has carbon dioxide to make it bubbly.
    
    Popular sparking wines include prosecco, champagne, and cava.
    
    One serving of sparkling wine has around 100 calories.
    
    Fortified
    Fortified wines contain added distilled alcohol. After the grapes are fermented, they’re fortified with spirits like brandy, increasing the alcohol content.
    
    Vermouth is a type of fortified white wine commonly used in cocktails. Other popular fortified wines are marsala, Disaronno, and sherry.
    
    One serving of fortified wine can have almost double the amount of calories as a red wine.
    
    Beer and other beverages
    One serving of beer is 355 mL or 12 fl oz.
    
    Lager
    Lager beers are crisp and made with a special type of yeast called Saccharomyces pastorianus. During fermentation, the yeast gathers at the bottom of a tank for a few months before being ready to enjoy.
    
    There are 3 main types of lager: pale, dark, and Vienna.
    
    One serving of pale lager (like a Pilsner) typically has 4–6% ABV and around 150 calories.
    </p><br><br><br><br>
    <p class="one" id="c">
    Ale
    Ale is made from another form of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This type of yeast rises to the top of the tank during fermentation, giving the alcohol an aromatic flavor profile.
    
    There are 12 main types of ale. Popular ales include:
    
    American pale ales (APA)
    India pale ales (IPA)
    stouts
    porters
    One serving of ale typically has 3-3.5% ABV, with some special ales going up to 12% ABV. One serving of IPA has around 200 calories.
    
    Lambic
    Lambic is a wheat beer fermented through exposure to wild yeasts and bacteria in Belgian. There are several types, including gueuze, kriek, and fruit Lambic beer.
    
    One serving of Lambic typically has 2–6% ABV and around 200 calories.
    
    Other fermented beverages
    Other beverages can be created by fermenting different types of sugars.
    
    Cider, for example, is made from fermented apples. A 12 oz serving of alcoholic cider usually has a 5% ABV and around 120 calories.
    
    Mead is a mashup of fermented honey and water and has 5–20% ABV. A 6 fl oz serving has around 250 calories.
    
    Kombucha comes from sugared tea that has been fermented and introduced to yeast. Store-bought kombucha has an alcohol content of 0.5% and around 120 calories. Kombucha spiked with additional alcohol (“hard kombucha”) will have a higher alcohol content.

      <p class="one">
     Frequently asked questions
    What’s the difference between distilled and undistilled liquor?
    Alcoholic beverages fall into one of two categories — distilled and undistilled.
    
    Undistilled spirits are taken through the fermentation process to create ethanol. Distilled spirits are put through a second process where the water is removed to increase the ABV.
    
    What type of alcohol is the strongest?
    Distilled liquors are considered the strongest type of alcohol. Spirytus is a vodka that’s 192 proof with the highestTrusted Source ABV (96%) on the market.
    
    What type of alcohol is the least potent?
    Beer is the least potent alcoholic beverage, with some light beers coming in as low as 2% ABV.
    
    The bottom line
    Many different ingredients and processes can create alcohol. The alcohol content of each drink is determined by the amount of pure ethanol per 100 mL or 3.4 oz.
    
    Whatever your drink of choice, stay safe and drink responsibly.

    Recommendation
    Bottom line
    According to the NIAAA, past research overestimates the benefits of moderate drinking, and current research indicates that even low levels of drinking have added risks. Though wine has been associated with health benefits, it should not be mistaken for a health drink.
    
    People have been drinking wine for thousands of years, and the benefits of doing so have been well documented (1Trusted Source).
    
    However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) have both released public statements asserting that no amount of alcohol should be considered safe and even low levels have added risks (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).
    
    Though drinking wine has been shown to have some health benefits, if you don’t currently drink, you shouldn’t start drinking for the health benefits.

    Potential benefits of drinking wine 
    Most research on drinking wine has been observational, meaning it has shown a link rather than conclusive proof of its benefits. Further studies are needed to establish whether small amounts of red wine are beneficial for health (4Trusted Source).
    
    Rich in antioxidants
    There are many antioxidant-rich foods and beverages, and wine is one of them.
    
    Antioxidants are compounds that prevent cellular damage caused by inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is a condition caused by an imbalance between antioxidants and unstable molecules called free radicals, which can damage your cells (5Trusted Source).
    
    Grapes have high levels of polyphenols, which are antioxidants that have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (6Trusted Source).
    
    Because red wine grapes are higher in antioxidants than white grape varieties, drinking red wine may increase your blood antioxidant levels to a greater extent than drinking white (7Trusted Source).
    
    One 2023 meta-analysis concluded that moderate amounts of red wine, in the context of a Mediterranean diet, showed beneficial effects on the oxidative status of healthy subjects due to the increased expression of antioxidant enzymes (8Trusted Source).
    
    Higher antioxidant status is associated with a decreased risk of disease (9Trusted Source).
    
    May help combat inflammation
    Wine contains compounds that have anti-inflammatory properties.
    
    Chronic inflammation is harmful and may increase the risk of conditions such as heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and certain cancers. Therefore, it’s best to prevent this type of inflammation as much as possible (10Trusted Source).
    
    Chronic inflammation can be reduced through diet, stress reduction, and exercise.
    
    Many foods have the power to reduce inflammation, and wine is thought to be one of them.
    
    Studies suggest that a compound called resveratrol in wine has anti-inflammatory properties and may benefit health (11Trusted Source).
    
    A 2021 trial study of coronary heart disease patients found that low to moderate wine consumption lowered their inflammation (12Trusted Source).
    
    Meanwhile, a 2018 study determined that moderate alcohol consumption helped prevent inflammation from rheumatoid arthritis, though it didn’t affect the severity of already-existing inflammation (13Trusted Source).
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class="one" id="d">
    May benefit heart health
    Studies show that individuals who consume moderate amounts of wine have a lower risk of heart disease mortality when compared with beer or spirits. However, a higher risk for cardiovascular disease mortality was typically seen with heavier daily or weekly alcohol consumption across all types of beverages. (14Trusted Source).
    
    The authors of this study noted that observational studies like this one may overestimate the benefits of alcohol for heart disease. There are many confounding factors such as lifestyle or genetics that may likely explain some of the association.
    
    Researchers believe that red wine’s high concentration of polyphenol antioxidants can help reduce your risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and metabolic diseases (15Trusted Source).
    
    Yet, other studies suggest that a daily glass of red wine does not reduce blood pressure in people with normal blood pressure or those who already have heart disease (16Trusted Source).
    
    What’s more, wine may interact with medication that lowers blood pressure (17Trusted Source).
    
    Furthermore, excessive alcohol consumption may have negative effects on heart health, including increased blood pressure and a higher risk of developing heart disease (18Trusted Source).
    
    Whether moderate wine intake benefits heart health is up for debate as research in this area continues (19Trusted Source).
    
    Other benefits
    Drinking wine in moderation may also have other benefits:
    
    May benefit mental health. An occasional glass of wine may reduce the risk of depression. However, excessive drinking can have the opposite effect, putting you at a higher risk of this condition (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).
    May promote longevity. Studies have found that drinking moderate amounts of wine as part of a healthy diet is linked with increased longevity (22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source).
    May promote healthy gut bacteria. Recent studies have even suggested that red wine may promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, which may improve metabolic syndrome markers in people with obesity (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source).
    SUMMARY
    Some research suggests that drinking wine in moderation provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits that may improve your gut bacteria and boost your heart health, mental health, and longevity. However, most research has focused on red wine.
    
  </p>
    <h1> Which type of wine has the most benefit? </h1>
    <p class="one">
    Many people wonder about the differences between red and white wine.
    
    Unfortunately, more research on white wine is needed, as most studies analyzing the benefits of drinking wine has focused on the beneficial properties of red wine.
    
    Red wine has been widely acknowledged for its high concentration of resveratrol, a potent antioxidant found in grape skins (25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).
    
    In fact, red wine has up to 10 times more resveratrol than white wine (26Trusted Source).
    
    SUMMARY
    Red wine likely provides more health benefits than white wine. However, more research is needed, particularly on white wine.
    
    Potential downsides
    Excessive alcohol intake can be harmful. Binge drinking and consuming high amounts of alcohol is associated with negative health outcomes (27Trusted Source).
    
    In fact, an average of 140,557 people die in the United States each year due to excessive alcohol consumption (28).
    
    Heavy alcohol consumption poses several health risks, including an increased risk of certain cancers, heart disease, liver and pancreatic diseases, as well as unintentional injury (29Trusted Source).
    
    In a 2020 meta-analysis, the risk of breast cancer was increased 8.9% with an increase of 10 grams of wine a day (30Trusted Source).
    
    The US government’s most recent dietary guidelines make similar recommendations. They suggest that, if you drink alcohol, you should do so in moderation, which means one drink for women and up to two drinks for men per day (31Trusted Source).
    
    Additionally, certain individuals should abstain from alcohol, including minors, pregnant women, and individuals on certain medications (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).
    
    SUMMARY
    While moderate wine consumption may have health benefits, excessive alcohol intake can have negative health outcomes. Certain individuals and populations should abstain from drinking alcohol.
    
    
    Should you drink wine for your health? 
    Drinking wine will not benefit your health more than not drinking at all. But if you choose to drink for enjoyment, the best choice is to do so in moderation, and in combination with a healthy diet, including antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables (2Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source),
    
    Research has found the optimal daily amount to be 1 glass (150 ml) for women and 2 glasses (300 ml) for men. This regimen is part of a Mediterranean diet and has been associated with beneficial health outcomes and disease prevention (23Trusted Source, 31Trusted Source).
    
    Although research suggests that drinking a glass of wine has several potential health benefits, they can also be obtained by eating a healthy diet.
    
    In other words, if you didn’t drink wine before, you don’t need to start simply for the health benefits.
    </p><br><br><br>
    <p class="one" id="e">
    For example, a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fiber, legumes, fish, and nuts already provides high amounts of antioxidants and helps prevent heart disease (38Trusted Source).
    
    SUMMARY
    While a daily glass of wine can benefit your health, you can reap the same health benefits by consuming a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and other whole foods.
    
    The bottom line
    Research suggests that drinking an occasional glass of red wine is not without benefits, but the WHO still recommends that no level of alcohol intake is safe, and that even low levels of drinking can increase health risks, including the risk of breast cancer (2Trusted Source).
    
    Some chemicals in wine provide antioxidants, may promote longevity, and can help protect against heart disease and harmful inflammation, among other benefits.
    
    Interestingly, red wine likely has higher levels of antioxidants than white wine. Still, more research is needed to better understand which types of wine provide the most benefits.
    
    However, it’s important to remember that drinking wine is not healthy for everyone, nor is it necessary. You can reap the same benefits by consuming a healthy diet.

      Chemical analyses recently confirmed that the earliest alcoholic beverage in the world was a mixed fermented drink of rice, honey, and hawthorn fruit and/or grape.
    
    The residues of the beverage, dated ca. 7000–6600 BCE, were recovered from early pottery from Jiahu, a Neolithic village in the Yellow River Valley. This beverage currently predates the earliest evidence of grape wine from the Middle East by more than 500 years.

    PROJECT OVERVIEW
    Chemical analyses of ancient organics absorbed, and preserved, in pottery jars from the Neolithic village of Jiahu, in Henan province, Northern China, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey, and fruit was being produced as early as 9,000 years ago, approximately the same time that barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East.
    
    In addition, liquids more than 3,000 years old, remarkably preserved inside tightly lidded bronze vessels, were chemically analyzed. These vessels from the capital city of Anyang and an elite burial in the Yellow River Basin, dating to the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties (ca. 1250-1000 BCE), contained specialized rice and millet "wines." The beverages had been flavored with herbs, flowers, and/or tree resins, and are similar to herbal wines described in the Shang dynasty oracle inscriptions. 
    
    The new discoveries, made by an international, multi-disciplinary team of researchers including the Penn Museum's archaeochemist Dr. Patrick McGovern, provide the first direct chemical evidence for early fermented beverages in ancient Chinese culture, thus broadening our understanding of the key technological and cultural roles that fermented beverages played in China.
    
    The discoveries and their implications for understanding ancient Chinese culture are published in the PNAS Early Edition (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences): "Fermented Beverages of Pre-and Proto-historic China," by Patrick E. McGovern, Juzhong Zhang, Jigen Tang, Zhiquing Zhang, Gretchen R. Hall, Robert A. Moreau, Alberto Nuñez, Eric D. Butrym, Michael P. Richards, Chen-shan Wang, Guangsheng Cheng, Zhijun Zhao, and Changsui Wang. Dr. McGovern worked with this team of researchers, associated with the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, the Institute of Archaeology in Beijing, the Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology of Henan Province, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Firmenich Corporation, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig (Germany), and the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
    
    Dr. McGovern first met with archaeologists and scientists, including his co-authors on the paper, in China in 2000, returning there in 2001 and 2002. Because of the great interest in using modern scientific techniques to investigate a crucial aspect of ancient Chinese culture, collaboration was initiated and samples carried back to the U.S. for analysis. Chemical tests of the pottery from the Neolithic village of Jiahu was of special interest, because it is some of the earliest known pottery from China. This site was already famous for yielding some of the earliest musical instruments and domesticated rice, as well as possibly the earliest Chinese pictographic writing. Through a variety of chemical methods including gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, and stable isotope analysis, finger-print compounds were identified, including those for hawthorn fruit and/or wild grape, beeswax associated with honey, and rice.

    The prehistoric beverage at Jiahu, Dr. McGovern asserts, paved the way for unique cereal beverages of the proto-historic 2nd millennium BCE, remarkably preserved as liquids inside sealed bronze vessels of the Shang and Western Zhou Dynasties. The vessels had become hermetically sealed when their tightly fitting lids corroded, preventing evaporation. Numerous bronze vessels with these liquids have been excavated at major urban centers along the Yellow River, especially from elite burials of high-ranking individuals. Besides serving as burial goods to sustain the dead in the afterlife, the vessels and their contents can also be related to funerary ceremonies in which living intermediaries communicated with the deceased ancestor and gods in an altered state of consciousness after imbibing a fermented beverage.
    
    "The fragrant aroma of the liquids inside the tightly lidded jars and vats, when their lids were first removed after some three thousand years, suggested that they indeed represented Shang and Western Zhou fermented beverages, " Dr. McGovern noted. Samples of liquid inside vessels from the important capital of Anyang and the Changzikou Tomb in Luyi county were analyzed. The combined archaeochemical, archaeobotanical and archaeological evidence for the Changzikou Tomb and Anyang liquids point to their being fermented and filtered rice or millet "wines," either jiu or chang, its herbal equivalent, according to the Shang Dynasty oracle inscriptions. Specific aromatic herbs (e.g., wormword), flowers (e.g., chrysanthemum), and/or tree resins (e.g., China fir and elemi) had been added to the wines, according to detected compounds such as camphor and alpha-cedrene, beta-amyrin and oleanolic acid, as well as benzaldehyde, acetic acid, and short-chain alcohols characteristic of rice and millet wines.
    
    Both jiu and chang of proto-historic China were likely made by mold saccharification, a uniquely Chinese contribution to beverage-making in which an assemblage of mold species are used to break down the carbohydrates of rice and other grains into simple, fermentable sugars. Yeast for fermentation of the simple sugars enters the process adventitiously, either brought in by insects or settling on to large and small cakes of the mold conglomerate (qu) from the rafters of old buildings. As many as 100 special herbs, including wormwood, are used today to make qu, and some have been shown to increase the yeast activity by as much as seven-fold.
    
    For Dr. McGovern, who began his role in the Chinese wine studies in 2000, this discovery offers an exciting new chapter in our rapidly growing understanding of the importance of fermented beverages in human culture around the world. In 1990, he and colleagues Rudolph H. Michel and Virginia R. Badler first made headlines with the discovery of what was then the earliest known chemical evidence of wine, dating to ca. 3500-3100 BCE, from Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran (see "Drink and Be Merry!: Infrared Spectroscopy and Ancient Near Eastern Wine" in Organic Contents of Ancient Vessels: Materials Analysis and Archaeological Investigation, eds. W. R. Biers and P.E. McGovern, MASCA Research Papers in Science and Archaeology, vol. 7, Philadelphia: MASCA, University of Pennsylvania Museum, University of Pennsylvania). That finding was followed up by the earliest chemically confirmed barley beer in 1992, inside another vessel from the same room at Godin Tepe that housed the wine jars. In 1994, chemical testing confirmed resinated wine inside two jars excavated by a Penn archaeological team at the Neolithic site of Hajji Firuz Tepe, Iran, dating to ca. 5400 BCE and some 2000 years earlier than the Godin Tepe jar. Dr. McGovern is author of Ancient Wine: The Search for the Origins of Viniculture (Princeton University Press, 2003).
    
    Dr. McGovern's research was made possible by support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Henry Luce Foundation, and the National Science Foundation (2000-2001; award BCS-9911128). The GC-MS analyses were carried out in the Chemistry Department of Drexel University through the kind auspices of J. P. Honovich. Dr. McGovern also thanks the Institute of Archaeology in Beijing and Zhengzhou for logistical support and providing samples for analysis. Qin Ma Hui, Wuxiao Hong, Hsing-Tsung Huang, Shuicheng Li, Guoguang Luo, Victor Mair, Harold Olmo, Vernon Singleton, and Tiemei Chen variously advised on or facilitated the research. Changsui Wang, chairperson of the Archaeometry program at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei (Anhui Province) was untiring in his enthusiasm for the project, and personally accompanied Dr. McGovern on travels to excavations and institutes, where collaborations and meetings with key scientists and archaeologists were arranged.
    
    Dogfish Head Brewery(Rehoboth Beach and Milton, DE) recreated this ancient Neolithic beverage, which was first tasted at a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York City, 19 May 2005.
