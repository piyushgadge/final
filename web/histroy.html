        The oldest verifiable brewery has been found in a prehistoric burial site in a cave near Haifa in modern-day Israel.
 Researchers have found residue of 13,000-year-old beer that they think might have been used for ritual feasts to honor the dead. 
The traces of a wheat-and-barley-based alcohol were found in stone mortars carved into the cave floor.
[4] Some have proposed that alcoholic drinks predated agriculture and it was the desire for alcoholic drinks that lead to agriculture and civilization.[5][6]

As early as 7000 BC, chemical analysis of jars from the Neolithic village Jiahu in the Henan province of northern China revealed traces of a mixed fermented beverage.
 According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences[7] in December 2004,[8] chemical analysis of the residue 
confirmed that a fermented drink made of grapes, hawthorn berries, honey, and rice was being produced in 7000–6650 BC.[9][10] This is approximately
 the time when barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East.

Evidence of alcoholic beverages has also been found dating from 5400 to 5000 BC in Hajji Firuz Tepe in Iran,[11] 3150 BC in ancient Egypt,[12] 
3000 BC in Babylon,[13] 2000 BC in pre-Hispanic Mexico[13] and 1500 BC in Sudan.[14] According to Guinness, the earliest firm evidence of wine production
 dates back to 6000 BC in Georgia.[11][15]

The medicinal use of alcohol was mentioned in Sumerian and Egyptian texts dating from about 2100 BC. The Hebrew Bible recommends giving alcoholic drinks 
to those who are dying or depressed, so that they can forget their misery (Proverbs 31:6–7).

In 55 BC the Romans took notice of an alcoholic cider being made in Britain using native apples, it quickly became popular and was imported back to the 
continent where it spread rapidly. People in Northern Spain were making cider around the same time period.[16][17] Celtic people were known to have been
 making types of alcoholic cider as early as 3000 BC.[18][19]

Wine was consumed in Classical Greece at breakfast or at symposia, and in the 1st century BC it was part of the diet of most Roman citizens. Both the 
Greeks and the Romans generally drank diluted wine (the strength varying from 1 part wine and 1 part water, to 1 part wine and 4 parts water). [citation needed]

In Europe during the Middle Ages, beer, often of very low strength, was an everyday drink for all classes and ages of people. A document from that time
 mentions nuns having an allowance of six pints of ale each day.[citation needed] Cider and pomace wine were also widely available; grape wine was the 
prerogative of the higher classes.[citation needed]

By the time the Europeans reached the Americas in the 15th century, several native civilizations had developed alcoholic beverages. According to a
 post-conquest Aztec document, consumption of the local "wine" (pulque) was generally restricted to religious ceremonies but was freely allowed to those 
who were older than 70 years.[20] The natives of South America produced a beer-like beverage from cassava or maize, which had to be chewed before fermentation 
in order to turn the starch into sugar (beverages of this kind are known today as cauim or chicha). This chewing technique was also used in ancient Japan 
to make sake from rice and other starchy crops.[citation needed]

<h2>Ancient India</h2>
Alcohol distillation likely originated in India.[28] Alcoholic beverages in the Indus Valley civilization appeared in the Chalcolithic Era. These beverages were in use between 3000 BC and 2000 BC. Sura, a beverage brewed from rice meal, wheat, sugar cane, grapes, and other fruits, was popular among the Kshatriya warriors and the peasant population.[29] Sura is considered to be a favorite drink of Indra.
[30]

The Hindu Ayurvedic texts describe both the beneficent uses of consuming alcoholic beverages and the consequences of intoxication and alcoholic diseases.
 Ayurvedic texts concluded that alcohol was a medicine if consumed in moderation, but a poison if consumed in excess.[30] Most of the people in 
India and China, have continued, throughout, to ferment a portion of their crops and nourish themselves with the alcoholic product.

In ancient India, alcohol was also used by the orthodox population. Early Vedic literature suggests the use of alcohol by priestly classes.[31]

The two great Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, mention the use of alcohol. In Ramayana, alcohol consumption is depicted in a good/bad dichotomy. 
The bad faction members consumed meat and alcohol while the good faction members were abstinent vegetarians. However, in Mahabharata, the characters are
 not portrayed in such a black-white contrast.[32]

Alcohol abstinence was promoted as a moral value in India by Mahavira, the founder of Jainism, and Adi Shankaracharya.[31]

Distillation was known in the ancient Indian subcontinent, evident from baked clay retorts and receivers found at Taxila and Charsadda in modern
 Pakistan, dating back to the early centuries of the Common Era. These "Gandhara stills" were only capable of producing very weak liquor, as there was
 no efficient means of collecting the vapors at low heat.[33]

<h2> Ancient China</h2>
Main article: History of alcohol in China
The earliest evidence of wine was found in what is now China, where jars from Jiahu which date to about 7000 BC were discovered. This early rice wine was produced by fermenting rice, honey, and fruit.[21] What later developed into Chinese civilization grew up along the more northerly Yellow River and fermented a kind of huangjiu from millet. The Zhou attached great importance to alcohol and ascribed the loss of the mandate of Heaven by the earlier Xia and Shang as largely due to their dissolute and alcoholic emperors. An edict ascribed to c. 1116 BC makes it clear that the use of alcohol in moderation was believed to be prescribed by heaven.

Unlike the traditions in Europe and the Middle East, China abandoned the production of grape wine before the advent of writing and, under the Han, abandoned beer in favor of huangjiu and other forms of rice wine. These naturally fermented to a strength of about 20% ABV; they were usually consumed warmed and frequently flavored with additives as part of traditional Chinese medicine. They considered it spiritual food and extensive documentary evidence attests to the important role it played in religious life. "In ancient times people always drank when holding a memorial ceremony, offering sacrifices to gods or their ancestors, pledging resolution before going into battle, celebrating victory, before feuding and official executions, for taking an oath of allegiance, while attending the ceremonies of birth, marriage, reunions, departures, death, and festival banquets."[citation needed] Marco Polo's 14th century record indicates grain and rice wine were drunk daily and were one of the treasury's biggest sources of income.

Alcoholic beverages were widely used in all segments of Chinese society, were used as a source of inspiration, were important for hospitality, were considered an antidote for fatigue, and were sometimes misused. Laws against making wine were enacted and repealed forty-one times between 1100 BC and AD 1400. However, a commentator writing around 650 BC asserted that people "will not do without beer. To prohibit it and secure total abstinence from it is beyond the power even of sages. Hence, therefore, we have warnings on the abuse of it."[22]

The Chinese may have independently developed the process of distillation in the early centuries of the Common Era, during the Eastern Han dynasty.[23]

Alcohols, in various forms, are used medically as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and antidote.[1] Alcohols applied to the skin are used to disinfect 
skin before a needle stick and before surgery.[2] They may also be used as a hand sanitizer;[2] to clean other areas;[2] and in mouthwashes.
[3][4][5] Taken by mouth or injected into a vein, ethanol is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity when fomepizole is not available.[1]

Side effects of alcohols applied to the skin include skin irritation.[2] Care should be taken with electrocautery, as ethanol is flammable.[1] 
Types of alcohol used include ethanol, denatured ethanol, 1-propanol, and isopropyl alcohol.[6][7] Alcohols are effective against a range of 
microorganisms, though they do not inactivate spores.[7] Concentrations of 60% to 90% work best.[7]

Medical uses
95% ABV ethanol is known as spiritus fortis in medical context.

Alcohol septal ablation
Main article: Alcohol septal ablation
Ablysinol (a brand of 99% ethanol medical alcohol) was sold from $1,300 to $10,000 per 10-pack[Give volume amount please] in 2020 due to FDA administrator
 action granting exclusivity when used for treating hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with Alcohol septal ablation in the US through 2025, despite 
"misuse" of the orphan drug act.[8][9][10][unreliable source?]

Antiseptics and disinfectants
Alcohols
Ethanol is listed under Antiseptics, and Alcohol based hand rub under Disinfectants, on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[11]

Applied to the skin, alcohols are used to disinfect skin before a needle stick and before surgery.[2] They may be used both to disinfect the skin
 of the person and the hands of the healthcare providers.[2] They can also be used to clean other areas,[2] and in mouthwashes.[3]

Both ethanol and isopropyl alcohol are common ingredients in topical antiseptics, including hand sanitizer.[12]

Treatment for ethylene glycol toxicity, and methanol toxicity
When taken by mouth or injected into a vein ethanol is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity[13] when fomepizole is not available.[1]

Mechanism
Ethanol, when used for toxicity, competes with other alcohols for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, lessening metabolism into toxic aldehyde and
 carboxylic acid derivatives, and reducing more serious toxic effect of the glycols to crystallize in the kidneys.[14]

Sclerosant
Absolute ethanol is used as a sclerosant in sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy has been used "in the treatment of simple pleural effusions, vascular malformations, 
lymphocytes and seromas."[15]

Sedative
Ethchlorvynol, developed in the 1950s, was used to treat insomnia, but prescriptions for the drug had fallen significantly by 1990, as other hypnotics
 that were considered safer (i.e., less dangerous in overdose) became much more common. It is no longer prescribed in the United States due to unavailability,
 but it is still available in some countries and would still be considered legal to possess and use with a valid prescription.
